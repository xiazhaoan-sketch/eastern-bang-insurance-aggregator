# Sprint 2 Review

---

## 🗓️ Sprint Details

* **Duration:** 2025-11-05 to 2025-11-12

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal & Outcome

**Goal:** Develop and deliver the complete, end-to-end user flow for the insurance website, from initial onboarding and plan listing to the final plan comparison.

**Outcome:** **Partially Achieved.** The team successfully delivered the entire core user flow (10 of 12 stories), from the landing page to the plan comparison table. Two stories (navigation and performance) were de-prioritized and will be moved to the next sprint.

## ❌ Incomplete User Stories

    * **Disposition:** **Carry over** to the next sprint.

* **[Story 12] Performance Optimization (5 pts)**
    * **Reason:** Considered a non-critical feature for the initial class project demo.
    * **Disposition:** **Carry over** to the next sprint.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

* **Coordination in a Large Team:** With five members in a class project, aligning schedules for synchronous work (like task division and prioritization) was a significant challenge. We learned we need to rely more on asynchronous communication tools or establish a single, recurring weekly "sync" time that everyone respects.

* **Leveraging AI for Efficiency:** The strategic use of AI-powered tools (like code assistants and documentation generators) proved highly effective. It significantly accelerated our development velocity and allowed the team to focus on complex logic rather than boilerplate tasks.

## 🚀 Product Backlog Updates

* **New Item Added:** Define "Select Plan" Functionality
    * *Note: The "Select Plan" button (Story 8) is implemented, but no action is currently tied to it. The next sprint must define what happens on-click (e.g., "Navigate to purchase summary page," "Save to user profile").*

* **Carried Over Items:**
    * **[Story 11] Navigation Between Steps (3 pts)** - Now a high priority.
    * **[Story 12] Performance Optimization (5 pts)** - Remains a medium priority.
